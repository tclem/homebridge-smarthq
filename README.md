### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your [SmartHQ](https://www.geappliances.com/connect) appliances within HomeKit. The plugin:
  - requires your SmartHQ account credentials to work
  - connects to the SmartHQ cloud to discover and control your appliances

### Prerequisites

- To use this plugin, you will need to already have:
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org): latest version of `v22`, `v24` or `v26` - any other major version is not supported.
  - [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io): `v2` - refer to link for more information and installation instructions.

### Café Coffee Maker Fork

This fork implements brew and cancel controls for Café coffee makers. Install its prebuilt release on apt-packaged Homebridge hosts:

```sh
sudo hb-service add https://github.com/tclem/homebridge-smarthq/releases/download/v0.8.1-cafe.4/homebridge-plugins-homebridge-smarthq-0.8.1-cafe.4.tgz
sudo hb-service restart
sudo hb-service status
```

Do not install this fork from its Git source on a resource-constrained Homebridge host. Use the prebuilt release so the host does not install development dependencies or compile the plugin.

### Features

- **HomeKit Controller notifications** are supported for the Opal Ice Maker. To set up, install the HomeKit Controller app and configure notifications for each respective event. Put your HomeKit Controller client secret in the plugin advanced options, and the path associated with each available notification in the Opal device options. Supported events:
  - Ice Bucket Full
  - Production Progress Complete
  - Filter Maintenance Change Alert
  - Descale Needed Alert
  - Add Water Alert
